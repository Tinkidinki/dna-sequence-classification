# Genome Sequence Classification

## Problem Statement
Training data has been provided in which DNA sequences have been classified  based on whether an unknown motif X occurs repeatedly in a certain region or not. 

Learn the structure and perform this binary classification on test data. 

## Idea
- Since we are working with DNA sequence data, we need to optimise for this specific task.
- We used Pysster module
- Explain pysster

## Methodology
